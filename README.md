# Intro to Jupyter
### *Harlan Heilman*

Notebook documents or notebooks are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, markdown, etcâ€¦). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

There are several apps that are used to run notebooks but the most common two are Jupyter Lab for a more modern gui, and the classical Jupyter notebook witch is more bare bones. Luckily, both of these apps come with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a one stop shop for most things python and data science.

## Building Your Enviroment 

One of the benifits of using python is the ability to use pre built functions stored in a package to simplify and improve the speed of your scripts. To outline how this works it is important to understand how python scripts are ran. Python scritps are ran in an enviroment, this envoroment contains many other python scripts and files that can interact with eachother. So long as a script is in the envoroment you are working in, you can run it in any other script you care for. Packages contain many python scripts as functions and can be added to any enviroment you care for. 

Anacond starts you off with a base(root) envoroment, and it pre poluates this enviroment with packages that
